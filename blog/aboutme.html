            <p>
                Hello! I'm Frouk, I'm game modder and software developer(mostly utils for modders).
                <br>
                I've started modding long time ago, I've started modding with Cheat Engine, it was quite uneasy to learn it back then, and all of the mods in Cheat Table were just pointers to certain values that you could edit.
                Mostly I was annoying when I was modding with Cheat Engine, I didn't learn any assembly back then and was guessing if it was safe to change some values or not.
                My first game that I modded was GTA San Andreas, NFS Carbon and NFS Most Wanted. These were the games that I played a lot back then.
                My laptop was quite weak, I couldn't play any games besides old ones, so I was playing these games a lot.
                After Cheat Engine modding era, I started learning assembly to make more quality mods for games.
                I was indeed quite amateur back then, was slopy and was mainly making mods for myself. As making cheat tables for other people was quite uneasy, and I didn't knew what feature they wanted.
                I found out about IDA Pro, I was learning how to use it and was stuck with it more than a year, I also was learning the name mangling used for functions, first was GNU 3.0+ and afterwards Visual C++ name mangling.
                C++ was the language that I was learning for a quite long time, I was also an amateur and didn't understand anything. I used SoloLearn though it was only basics of C++ and was only targetting how to print out the information to a console.
                Used GitHub to learn C++, mostly the knowledge was from other people's code.
                <br>
                Started learning C# to make mods for Unity Engine games, I didn't really played many games made in Unity Engine, but I was learning C# to make mods for them.
                First game that I modded in Unity Engine was a game called "Muck" by Dani. The only mod that I made for this game was a mod that was changing amount of powerups as I couldn't do more complex features.
                After that I found out about the game called "Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance", I've done nothing but reversing the game for a long time, I could say two years or so.
                There wasn't any .asi mods, I was wondering why, there was a .DLL mod that was used to skip credits and stuff, but it wasn't enough, I started making a Mod Menu for this game, and decided to do it for every game that I played.
                I've uploaded a few mods for this game, and they were quite popular, I was happy that people liked my mods. There wasn't many modders for this game, I was one of the first ones.
                I've uploaded a repository that was targeted to make .asi mods for this game, it was acting as a Side Loaded DLL, I was only the one who could reverse this game as the community of the modding was quite small. I wished that people would join reversing but most of them don't know how a pointer works in C++.
                I was uploading mods for the game at it's peak of popularity due to it's memes, popularity was fading away and there wasn't much people left who played this game.
                You can look at my GitHub profile, you can see all the projects that I've done.
                <br>
                There isn't going to be an arc that I'm going to tell you about my life, I'm just a normal quiet person who likes modding and programming.
