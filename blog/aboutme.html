            <p>
                Hello! I'm Frouk, a passionate game modder and Software Engineer from Ukraine.<br>
                My journey began in 2019 when I started modding offline games using Cheat Engine. Over time, I expanded my skills to include Unity Engine modding also using Cheat Engine with mono features.<br>
                In my 9th grade, I took my time to research and learn C/C++ as well as Lua, x86/x64 Assembly and reverse engineering techinques.<br>
                Currently I'm focused on this website, various game mods and researching further into game and software development.<br>
                <br>
                First game that I have modded was "Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas" back in 2019. It sparked my interest in game modding and development. Why GTA San Andreas? Since I didn't had powerful PC to handle games that were released that year<br>
                I decided to start with something that my PC could handle. Over time I moved to more complex games and engines.<br>
                Had an upgrade in 2023 which allowed me to explore more modern games and engines like Unity.<br>
                <br>
                Over the years I tried modding various games including but not limited to: GTA San Andreas, Among Us, NFS Carbon, NFS Most Wanted, NFS ProStreet, Muck, Infinitode 2, <em>Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance</em> and more.<br>
                Each game presented its own challenges and learning opportunities, helping me to grow as a modder and developer.<br>
                <br>
                Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance holds a special place in my heart as it was the first AAA game I modded. The experience was both challenging and rewarding, pushing me to deepen my understanding of game mechanics and modding techniques.<br>
                I've created several mods and tools for MGR, including a plugin framework, ImGui integration template, and a Mod Loader.<br>
                The list is included but not limited to: Photo Mod, Free Camera, Ini Tweaker, Mod Menu, Time Stop, Debug Menu(not for public) and more.<br>
                <br>
                I finished my school in 2025 to later then focus on preparing for university and furthering my knowledge in Software Engineering and Game Development.<br>
                I'm excited to continue my journey in the world of game modding and development, constantly learning and pushing the boundaries of what's possible.<br>
                <br>
                Feel free to explore my projects and blog posts to learn more about my work and experiences in the modding community!
